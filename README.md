## Tour of tools

### Design decisions

#### Building from scratch vs. Wordpress, Wix etc.
- I wanted full control since I'm already familiar with coding
- Wanted to avoid cookie cutter WordPress look, fighting with templates, paid features etc.

#### Self-hosting videos vs. embedding from YouTube/Vimeo
-

### Tools
1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) - *The editor where I write all my code*
2. [GitHub](https://github.com/) - *Where you'll host the raw source code (similar to collaborative Google Docs)*
3. [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) - *The backend where I host the website and content database*
4. [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage) - *Where I host the actual video content (as opposed to embedding YouTube/Vimeo videos)*

### Helpful learning resources
1. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/114543/how-to-horizontally-center-an-element) - *The authoritative coding Q&A forum - usually the 1st site that will come up whenever you google a 'How do I do X?' coding question*
2. [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/) - *Super clear tutorials for basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript stuff. It has really cool [Try it Yourself](https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_default) windows where you can live-edit sample code and then see what it does to the webpage in real-time
