  <h1>Lino Kino Web Workshop</h1>

  <p>
    I got to bet that your old man
    Became fascinated with his own plans
    Turned you loose, your mama too
    There wasn't a thing that you could do
    I got faith in you, it's the kind of love
    That cuts clean through
    I got faith in you, it's a razor love
    And it's true
    And you really made my day
    With the little things you say
    Right now I'm looking through the window at a silhouette
    Trying to find something I can find yet
    Imagination is my best friend
    Got to watch out for the greedy hand, greedy hand
    Make a living like a rolling stone
    On the road there's no place like home
    Silhouettes on the window
    Who was it made your eyes flicker like that
    Tell me baby, where do get a man
    I came to you with open arms
    And I really took you down the track
    Now all I've got for you is the kind of love
    That cuts clean through
    All I got for you is razor love
    That cuts clean through
    You really made my day
    With the little things you say
    Right now I'm looking through the window at a silhouette
    Trying to find something I can find yet
    Imagination is my best friend
    Got to watch out for the greedy hand, greedy hand
    Make a living like a rolling stone
    On the road there's no place like home
    Silhouettes on the window
    I got to bet that your old man
    Became fascinated with his own plans
