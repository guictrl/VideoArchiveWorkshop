  <h1>razor.love</h1>

  <p>
    I got to bet that your old man<br>
    Became fascinated with his own plans<br>
    Turned you loose, your mama too<br>
    There wasn't a thing that you could do<br>
    I got faith in you, it's the kind of love<br>
    That cuts clean through<br>
    I got faith in you, it's a razor love<br>
    And it's true<br>
    And you really made my day<br>
    With the little things you say<br>
    Right now I'm looking through the window at a silhouette<br>
    Trying to find something I can find yet<br>
    Imagination is my best friend<br>
    Got to watch out for the greedy hand, greedy hand<br>
    Make a living like a rolling stone<br>
    On the road there's no place like home<br>
    Silhouettes on the window<br>
    Who was it made your eyes flicker like that<br>
    Tell me baby, where do get a man<br>
    I came to you with open arms<br>
    And I really took you down the track<br>
    Now all I've got for you is the kind of love<br>
    That cuts clean through<br>
    All I got for you is razor love<br>
    That cuts clean through<br>
    You really made my day<br>
    With the little things you say<br>
    Right now I'm looking through the window at a silhouette<br>
    Trying to find something I can find yet<br>
    Imagination is my best friend<br>
    Got to watch out for the greedy hand, greedy hand<br>
    Make a living like a rolling stone<br>
    On the road there's no place like home<br>
    Silhouettes on the window<br>
    I got to bet that your old man<br>
    Became fascinated with his own plans<br>
